After a few months of probation, intern Elf McEager has passed with glowing feedback from Elf McSkidy. During the meeting, Elf McEager asked for more access to The Best Festival Company's (TBFC'z) internal network as he wishes to know more about the systems he has sworn to protect.

Elf McSkidy was reluctant to agree. However, after Elf McEager's heroic actions in recovering christmas, Elf McSkidy soon thought this was a good idea. This was uncharted territory for Elf McEager - he had no idea how to begin finding out this information for his new responsibilites. Thankfully, TBFC has a wonderful up-skill program covering the use of Nmap for ElfMcEager to enrol in.
