Even Santa has been having to adopt the "work from home" ethic in 2020. To help Santa out, Elf McSkidy and their team created a file server for The Best Festival Company (TBFC) that uses the FTP protocol. However, an attacker was able to hack this new server. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to understand how this hack occurred and to retrace the steps of the attacker.

- Name the directory on the FTP server that has data accessible by the "anonymous" user
```
public
```
- What script gets executed within this directory?
```
backup.sh
```
- What movie did Santa have on his Christmas shopping list?
```
The Polar Express
```
- Re-upload this script to contain malicious data (just like we did in section 9.6. Output the contents of /root/flag.txt!
```
